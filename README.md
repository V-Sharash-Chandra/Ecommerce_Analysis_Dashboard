📊 E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales, profit, and customer behavior from a Superstore dataset to uncover key business insights.
I designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI (validated with Python & Excel) that helps stakeholders monitor KPIs, track sales trends, and identify high-performing regions and categories.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and transform raw sales data for analysis.

Build KPIs to track Total Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Quantity Sold.

Visualize sales performance by Region, Category, Sub-Category, and Time.

Enable interactive filtering using slicers (Year, Month, Region).

Provide actionable insights for decision-making.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – data cleaning & exploratory analysis.

Excel – pivot tables and validation of key metrics.

SQL (MySQL Workbench) – initial data exploration (joins, aggregations).

Power BI – dashboard creation with DAX measures and slicers.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Superstore Sales Dataset

Records: ~10K transactions

Fields: Order Date, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category, Customer ID, Region, etc.

📊 Dashboard Features

✔️ KPI Cards – Total Sales (2.3M), Total Profit (0.29M), Profit Margin (12.5%), Total Quantity (38K)
✔️ Sales by Region (bar chart) – West is the most profitable region
✔️ Sales by Category (column chart) – Technology leads in revenue
✔️ Top Products & Cities – Top contributors to revenue
✔️ Monthly Sales Trend (line chart) – seasonal spikes in Q4
✔️ Slicers – interactive filters for Year, Month, and Region

📈 Insights

Technology category drives the highest sales across all regions.

West region consistently outperforms others in profit contribution.

Q4 shows peak sales due to seasonal demand.

Certain sub-categories (e.g., Phones, Copiers) dominate revenue.
